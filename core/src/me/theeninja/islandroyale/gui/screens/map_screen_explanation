Each island within a map is given an integral X coordinate and integral Y coordinate.

There are two options for implementing a map, with the second option having two functionally equivalent suboptions
 (with different views):

1) Have the map be 2D with borders
2a) Have the map be 3D shown as a sphere.
2b) Have the map be 3D shown as a 2D map with wrap-around.
